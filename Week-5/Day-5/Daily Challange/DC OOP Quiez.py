# Part 1

# What is a class?

# A class is a blueprint to create objects; it defines what properties(attributes) and behaviors(methods) the object
# created from it will have Classes are used to model real world objects and to organize related code - data and
# functions into a single and coherent place in the code Classes are an integral key in the OOP method of programming

# What is an instance? An instance is the result of a call to a Class - like ClassName() - you then instantiate the
# class and receive an object with the attrs and methods defined by the blueprint - the class. there can be many
# instances of one class. each can have different properties/attributes - with similar methods that can do different
# things because they can act based on different attributes

# What is encapsulation? encapsulation is a concept in oop, it comes from 'capsule' its means "encapsulating"
# everything that is related in the code - data (as attributes) and functions behaviors (as methods) #and putting it
# all together and not let it wander around the code, by that you also increase readability and coherency

# What is abstraction?
# Abstraction is a concept in oop, is one of the pillars of oop, it means abstractify and making the access to an
# object simpler and hiding the unnecessary details#from the "code users", they dont need to know Dog().talk() works,
#  they only need to have the class and the  method talk exposed (to have the interface with the class)
# and to receive the result "promised" by the class methods

# What is inheritance? inheritance is a concept in oop, it lets a class receive the properties and behaviors in a
# parent class, for example a Truck class can inherit from a parent class Vehicle - since a truck is a vehicle (but
# not every vehicle is a truck), and the Truck then can use the Vehicle class Drive() method by that we can reduce
# code and organize classes more logically, since drive method isnt needed to be declared twice, #  it can work also
# on the truck=Truck(Vehicle) and truck.Drive() will activate its parent class Drive method  but will be based on the
# truck props like truck.speed(self.speed inside the Truck class)

# What is multiple inheritance? multiple inheritance is a feature available in Python (and not in some other langs
# because it can make the code tricky), it lets a class inherit from more than one class. the class will receive the
# props and the methods from the multiple parent classes and not only one

# What is polymorphism? polymorphism means in many shapes, in practice its a concept in oop, it let's the user call a
# method, this method can be implemented differently - override - in different subclasses, but it is still available
# in all of them all the same for example Animal can have Talk method, Bear and Dog will be subclasses of Animal and
# they can both implement a Talk method of their own and you can call Bear().talk() and Dog.talk() and the first one
# can return 'ahhhhh' and the second can return 'woof And a Cat might not implement its own method of Talk and if you
# call Cat().Talk() it can use it's parent (Animal) Talk() method in TLDR; it can be said polymorphism is about
# different implementation of a parent(/base) class's function (method) in a subclass(/child class that inherits from
# it),

# What is method resolution order or MRO?
# Mro is a method of ordering what class a subclass will inherit from first in a case of multiple inheritance,
# it is need to figure out what method or attribute to use
# like if class D(B,C) the mro can be [class D, class B, class C] so if you call D.some_method() it will
# first look if D has some_method if it does it wil call it
# if not it will search on B then on C (same for looking for  attributes)

# from random import shuffle

# class Card:
#     def __init__(self, suit, value):
#         self.suit = suit
#         self.value = value
#     def __str__(self):
#         return f"{self.suit} {self.value}"
#
# class Cards: def __init__(self): self.cards = [Card(suit, value) for suit in ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs',
# 'Spades'] for value in ['A'] + list(range(2,11)) + ['J','Q','K']] def stack_card(self, card): self.cards.append(card)
#
# class Deck(Cards):
#     def shuffle(self):
#         if len(self.cards) == 52:
#             shuffle(self.cards)
#         else:
#             raise ValueError
#     def deal(self):
#         return self.cards.pop()
#
#
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     deck = Deck()
#     deck.shuffle()
#     for _ in range(10):
#         print(deck.deal())
